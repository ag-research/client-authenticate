## GSDLabs Client Authentication

This is a deliberate attempt to access the "exposed" authentication API built by the GSDLabs team. You provided the challenge, here is my response ;-). 

Okay, I'm sorry, it's not that serious. This is just a UI to prove that the authentication API works!

## Installation

To start app, clone to local then run commands in CLI

```
npm install
npm start
```

## Testing

Since there are over 60 tests in here, you can run this command in CLI to see if any of them fails

```
npm test
```
